# Format Templates

Why use a fancy templating language at all when Python has a built-in `format()` string function with curly braces (`{}`) already?


##About

I started this project so I could figure out how to create a static html templating system like Jekyl, but from scratch. Any and all contributions are welcome. Thanks!
